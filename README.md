# Project Management - Projects and Issues


When creating an issue:
 - tag it with appropriate labels (especially SmallEffort, MediumEffort, LargeEffort and LowPriority, MedPriority, HighPriority)
 - associate the issue with a project using the project selector on the right side of the page (if not adding to backlog project, de-select backlog when selecting target project)
