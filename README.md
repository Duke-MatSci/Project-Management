# Project Management - Projects and Issues


When creating an issue:
 - tag it with appropriate labels (especially small, medium, large and task/feature)
 - associate the issue with a project
 - Use same prefix in issue description for related items since direct relationships are not possible in github
   - e.g.
     - 'authentication v2'  (tags: feature, large - project: materialsmine vN.N)
     - 'authentication v2 - implement read groups' (tags: task, large - project: materialsmine vN.N)
     - 'authentication v2 - implement write groups' (tags: task, large - project: materialsmine vN.N)
     - 'authentication v2 - rework page access according to group access and test' (tags: task, large - project: materialsmine vN.N)
